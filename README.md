# To Do List Project

This is a simple To Do List project created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The project allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and clear the entire list.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the project.
- **style.css**: The CSS file that provides styling for the project, including Bootstrap styles.
- **to_do_list.js**: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for adding, marking, and removing tasks.
- **animate.min.css**: The CSS file containing animations from the Animate.css library.

## Features

- **Add New Task**: Users can add new tasks to the list by entering them in the input field and clicking the "Add New" button.

- **Mark as Completed**: Clicking on a task toggles its completion status, marking it with a line-through.

- **Invisible Effect**: Clicking on the "Casper" button applies a bounce-in-left animation to the completed tasks, making them appear invisible.

- **Clear All**: Clicking on the "Clear All" button removes all tasks from the list.
